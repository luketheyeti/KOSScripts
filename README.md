Scripts for KOS

currently running in 1.7. Designed for single stick rockets with basic staging:

1. first stage and any launch clamps.
2. side boosters if you have them.
3. stack separators and upper stage.
4. fairings probably but I need to make this an action group so it can't interfere with launch
5. stack separator for your payload.
